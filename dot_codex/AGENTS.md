# Global Guidelines

## Security and Privacy

- NEVER under any circumstances read any files under `~/.ssh` and other sensitive locations unless explicitly permitted to.
- Never append `?utm_source=` nor any tracking parameters to URLs you provide.

## General Coding

- When making modifications, make sure to always start from the latest on-disk source code, assuming any modifications were made knowlingly and should not be reverted. For example, if I remove a function that you just added, that is not accidental and the function should not be brought back. Same goes for renames, etc.

## Xcode / Swift Projects

- Do not hesitate to ask the user to perform actions if the most reliable way to make a change is to use the Xcode GUI, instead of trying to make edits to complex Xcode project files and ending up in an invalid state.
